            <h1>What is Context API?</h1>
            <p>The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

Context API is a (kind of) new feature added in version 16.3 of React that allows one to share state across the entire app (or part of it) lightly and with ease.</p>

<h1>What is Semantic Tag</h1>
<p>Semaintin tag is use for increase SEO in your website. Semantic elements have meaningful names which tells about type of content. For example header, footer, table, â€¦ etc. HTML5 introduces many semantic elements as mentioned below which make the code easier to write and understand for the developer as well as instructs the browser on how to treat them.
